Project Overview
This project explores the idea of optimizing traffic light timings using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to reduce traffic congestion and vehicle waiting times, as opposed to the traditional manually configured or fixed-timing traffic systems.
Our solution demonstrates how AI-driven traffic signal control can outperform static systems by adapting in real-time to actual traffic conditions.

Project Objectives
Show the effectiveness of RL-based traffic control versus fixed-timing methods.
Simulate and visualize real-world traffic scenarios.
Provide a web interface for users to interact with the simulation and observe performance comparisons.

Models Implemented
We trained and tested two models:
Fixed Model - Uses pre-defined, static signal timings.
RL Model - Learns optimal timing patterns using Reinforcement Learning.
Both models were developed in Python using TraCI (SUMO-Python interface) and trained for multiple episodes.
‚ö†Ô∏è We recommend training the RL model for at least 50 epochs for stable performance.

üìä Why It Matters
Traffic congestion is a major urban issue. Our project demonstrates that adopting a data-driven, adaptive approach to traffic control can significantly improve traffic flow, reduce fuel waste, and enhance commuter experience.
