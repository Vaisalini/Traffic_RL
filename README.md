Smart Traffic Management System using Reinforcement Learning

A web-based intelligent traffic management system that dynamically optimizes traffic light signals using real-time data and reinforcement learning. The project uses a Next.js frontend, Node.js backend, a Python-based ML model, and the SUMO traffic simulator.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React Framework)

Backend: Node.js with Express

ML Model: Python with TraCI (SUMO-Python interface)

Simulation: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)

Features:

Real-time traffic light control using reinforcement learning

Vehicle counting and congestion detection

SUMO-based traffic simulation with RL integration

Optional local SUMO-GUI visualization for live simulations
